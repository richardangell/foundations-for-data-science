## Exercises

Solve `2 + x - x^2 = 0`.

Solve `3(x + 2)^2 - 17(x + 2) - 6 = 0`.

Solve `x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0`.

For each of the above plot the function to confirm or approximately confirm the roots.

Find the discriminant and number of real roots of `4x^2 + 28x + 49 = 0`. Confrim by plotting the function.

Find the possible values of `k` for which `x^2 + kx + 4 = 0` has 2 real roots. Again confirm visually.
