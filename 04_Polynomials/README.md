Expansion of brackets rules;

```
a(b + c + d) = a.b + a.c + a.d
(a + b)(c + d) = a.c + a.d + b.c + b.d
(a + b)^2 = (a + b)(a + b) = a^2 + 2.a.b + b^2
(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - a.b + a.b -b^2 = a^2 - b^2
```

Factorising a quadratic (i.e. polynomial with up to squared terms) is converting from the form `a.x^2 + b.x + c` into the form `(d.x + e)(f.x + g)`.

Polynomials can be simpified by cancelling terms e.g.

`(2.x + 4)/(x^2 - 4) = 2(x + 2)/(x+2)(x - 2) = 2/(x - 2)`

A common denominator is required to add or subtract fractions e.g.

```
4/x(x - 2) + x/(x + 2)
= 4(x + 2)/x(x - 2)(x + 2) + x.x(x - 2)/(x + 2)x(x - 2) 
= (4x + 8 + x^3 - 2x)/x(x - 2)(x + 2) 
= (x^3 + 2x + 8)/x(x^2 - 4)
```

## Exercises

Factorise `x^2 + 4x - 21`. 

Simplify `(3x + 6)/(X^2 - 4)`.

Simplify `(3x/5) / ((3x^2 - 9x)/20)`.

For each of the above examples write two functions that return the value of the equation, one when it is factorised and one when it is not. Try running a few different values through the two functions to check the two are equivalent.
